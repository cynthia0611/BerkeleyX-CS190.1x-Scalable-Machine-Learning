BIG DATA TOOLS Why is using traditional analysis tools for big data a poor choice?

 Storage is becoming less expensive.  
 The time to read from a 1 TB drive is 3 hours.  
 Big data does not fit on a single machine. 
 Big data does not fit on a single machine. - correct  CPUs are getting faster and faster every year.


MODERN BIG DATA HARDWARE  Which of the following properties does modern hardware for big data have:

 Uses premium hardware  
 Uses consumer grade hardware  
 Uses complex hardware  
 Uses complex software  
 Easy to add capacity
Uses consumer grade hardware, Uses complex software, Easy to add capacity, - correct

USING DIVIDE AND CONQUER  What are some of the challenges of using divide and conquer:

 Moving data is very expensive  
 Using a single machine is faster than multiple machines  
 Having many machines means having to deal with many failures  
 Having many machines means having to deal with slow machines  
 Using hash tables for very large documents works well
Moving data is very expensive, Having many machines means having to deal with many failures, Having many machines means having to deal with slow machines, - correct

MAP REDUCE  Which of the following problems does a MapReduce implementation handle?

 Recovering from machine failures  
 Shuffling data between the Map and Reduce functions  
 Running the Map and Reduce functions on many machines  
 Recovering from slow machines
Recovering from machine failures, Shuffling data between the Map and Reduce functions, Running the Map and Reduce functions on many machines, Recovering from slow machines, - correct

MAP REDUCE AND SPARK DIFFERENCES  Spark is often faster than a traditional MapReduce implementation because:

 It sends less data over the network  
 Results do not need to be written to disk  
 It detects machine failures more quickly  
 It replicates the output of each task to recover from failures quickly
Results do not need to be written to disk, - correct
